# Joint Well Frontend

This is the front-end that I built for Joint Well and you can view the website at http://www.jointwellcaps.com/. My favourite part of the project was the products menu and it truly tested my ability to problem solve.

# Hardest Part Of Project

The most challenging part of this project was the Products page where I had find a cleaner way to complete the filter system, and creating a back-end so we can fetch the hats and their own unique tags (materials, styles, etc) for the filter system to work.
